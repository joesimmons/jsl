# About JoeSimmons' Library

**JSL** is a lightweight library that functions similar to _jQuery_. It is extendable via `JSL.fn`

It can be used for web pages, and also user-script extensions, like [Greasemonkey][gm].

It works in browsers that support ECMAScript-5 *(e.g., Firefox 3.6+, Chrome latest, etc)*.

For API documentation, check the [methods][methods] page.

### Notes
  * I recommend you view the source code in a monospaced font *(Consolas, Courier New, etc)*
  * This library uses [Semantic Versioning][semver] as of JSL **v1.2.0**

---

### TO-DO
  * add `.inView` or a similar method to determine if an element is in the browser's viewport
